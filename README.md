# HackerRank-Automation
Hackerrank automation using puppeteerjs I wrote a script using puppeteer which automates the process of login and adding multiple moderators to multiple contests in hackerrank. The purpose of writing this script was to get familiar with automation and async-await in JavaScript, while having a little fun.
to run the code in your system type-// npm init -y // npm install minimist // npm install puppeteer  
then type-// node Automation.js --url=https://www.hackerrank.com  --config=config.json
